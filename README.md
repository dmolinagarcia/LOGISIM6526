# LOGISIM6526
This is a (very experimental) implementation of a MOS6526 using logisim. In order to use the simulation, Drass' Logisim implementation of a 6502 CPU has been used.

Please keep in mind, this is heavily untested, and it's only made public for reference, and for anyone who feels like taking a chance a the project to be able to try it. I can offer no guarantee on the behaviour of the simulation.

Feel free to reach me if there's anything I can for you.
